## Labs
### Use after free
 - Overwite password before comparison to authenticate
 - Overwrite data to introduce format string

### Double free
 - Make password and user input point to the same chunk???

### Heap overflow
 - Classic gets() example
 - Overwrite C++ generated function pointers
 - 

# Notes

## House of prime

## House of Mind

## House of Force
In this technique, the attacker abuses the top chunk size and tricks glibc mallic into servicing a memory request larger than the heap memory size. Then when a new malloc request is made, GOT entry of free would be overwritten with shellcode address, so when free is called, shellcode gets executed.
